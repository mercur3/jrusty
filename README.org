What if Java was more like Rust?

** What this library provides
- A =Result= class following the specification of Rust's =std::result::Result= with 1 of the 2
  possible types: =Ok= or =Err=.
- Sane conversions from =java.lang.String= to =byte=, =int=, =long= without the need for:

  #+begin_src java
    try {
        /* assignment */ Integer.parseInt(someQuestionableStringWeGotAsInput);
    }
    catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
        // do something
    }
  #+end_src

- =null= safety for everything library provides.
